                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    At the clinic, travellers who have returned from the tropics and are
                    acutely unwell turn up without requiring an appointment to get treated
                    by specialists in tropical diseases. The team had been managing it&#8217;s
                    patients using a combination of spreadsheets, a big notebook for
                    review cases, a central document management system for letters,
                    and an access database for capturing research data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were tasked with understanding the needs of the front-line staff
                    as well as the research interests of the department, and designing
                    a service that met those needs.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What we did
                </h3>
                <p>
                    We started by working closely with clinicians who had worked in the
                    clinic, mapping the various different journies that a patient takes,
                    from when they first arrive, to when they leave the care of the service.
                    (That was either when they were sent home, or when their details were
                    crossed out in the big paper &#8216;review&#8217; notebook.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also tried to understand who the different people involved with
                    delivering the service are. As with most clinical services, they
                    operate with multidisciplinary teams, with people performing different
                    functions within it. We made sure that we understood the perspectives
                    of the nurses and administration staff, the junior doctors, and the
                    consultants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Building on these insights, we came up with a set of user journeys
                    that we felt would cover all of the different paths through the
                    service. At this stage, we hadn&#8217;t built anything - we had sketches,
                    descriptions of things, and lots of notes from conversations with the
                    people who would end up using the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, we shared these ideas with the future users, to see
                    what they thought, and what we&#8217;d gotten wrong. We made a few adjustments,
                    and started to build our first prototype.
                </p>
                <img class="bordered img-responsive"
                     src="/assets/images/posts/walkin.nurseledcare.png"
                     alt="" />
                <p>
                    We built the service using the
                    <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">OPAL</a> framework,
                    re-creating the journies we&#8217;d discussed in working code. Once we had a
                    working prototype, we started showing it to users - gathering their
                    feedback, and making adjustments based on what they told us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After iteratively following this process for a number of weeks, we
                    reached a point where everyone agreed that we had a service that would
                    support all the different teams in delivering care, while also capturing
                    high quality data to enable service audit and research.
                </p>
                <img class="bordered img-responsive"
                     src="/assets/images/posts/walkin.advice.png" alt=""
                     />
                <h3>The result</h3>
                <p>
                    We launched the service in September 2015, where we were able to replace
                    the various previous systems overnight. For the early weeks we were in
                    constant contact with the clinical staff, making sure that we responded
                    to the small issues that only real-world use of a service throws up.
                    Despite a few small issues, the transition has been a complete success.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even in the first few months since launch, enough data has been captured
                    about the work of the clinic that several abstracts for papers have been
                    submitted, and the team is now able to conduct clinical audits about their
                    activity that would previously have taken days or hours in just minutes.
