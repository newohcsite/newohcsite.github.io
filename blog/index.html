            <p>2015 has been a big year for us - so we thought we&rsquo;d take a moment and share
some of what we&rsquo;ve been up to:</p>

<h3>Delivering Digital Services for direct care</h3>

<p>We believe that the digital tools used to deliver patient care should be of the highest
possible quality. Not only do we believe it, we work hard to deliver them as well!</p>

<p>This year we launched two new services - for <a href="/blog/2015/02/05/elcid-opat-launch/">managing OPAT care</a>
at UCLH (patients who need regular IV drugs but aren&rsquo;t so sick that they need to stay in
hospital all the time), and for the returning traveller
<a href="/blog/2015/10/21/launching-a-new-walk-in-service/">walk in clinic</a> at the Hospital for
Tropical Diseases.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/posts/detail.view.png" alt="" style="border: 2px solid black;" />
</div>


<!--//post-thumb-->


<p>We&rsquo;ve also been working to iteratively improve the services we run - conducting user research
interviews, observing clinicians using our tools on the wards, and generally trying to establish
robust feedback loops and processes for users to tell us how we can make things better for them.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From the wards yesterday: &#10;&#10;&quot;You&#39;re actually coming and asking doctors how you can make the IT systems they use better? - That&#39;s unheard of&quot;</p>&mdash; David Miller (@thatdavidmiller) <a href="https://twitter.com/thatdavidmiller/status/642247781617397760">September 11, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Based on this research, we&rsquo;ve made lots of improvements to the UI of our services, coming up
with new design patterns for building applications for direct care in the process.</p>

<h1>Code</h1>

<p>Lots of this work invovles us writing, maintaining and improving code.</p>

<p>During 2014 We made 3 major <a href="/blog/2015/11/13/opal-05-released/">new releases</a> of
<a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">OPAL</a> - our framework
for building digital services for clnicians, not to mention many other smaller releases,
making up <b>2,416</b> individual commits across all
our <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare">Open Source projects</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout the year we&rsquo;ve been focussing on making our projects easier for new developers
to pick up - improving the <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs">documentation</a> and
refactoring things to provide better APIs for people to build on.</p>

            <p>We&rsquo;re happy to announce that we&rsquo;ve just released a new version of <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/">OPAL</a> -
our framework for building clinical facing digital services.</p>

<p>So - what&rsquo;s new in this release?</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve completely re-designed our search pages to help clinicians find
the patients they&rsquo;re interested in more easily. We also default to
having a search box in the navigation of every page.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhealthcare/openhealthcare.org.uk/master/source/assets/images/posts/search.results.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In addition, we&rsquo;ve been working hard to make search backends pluggable,
so that in the future you&rsquo;ll be able to drop in alternative backends of
your choice as your application scales.</p>

<h2>Patient List view</h2>

<p>We spent a lot of time over the past few months collating feedback from users and
doing research to understand how we could improve the core Patient List
views. As a response to that we&rsquo;ve updated the list interface - making it clearer
which patient is currently active, and removing some of the features that weren&rsquo;t
actually helping our users to care for patients.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhealthcare/openhealthcare.org.uk/master/source/assets/images/posts/list.view.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2>Subrecord metadata</h2>

<p>We added four new utility fields to
<a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/guides/datamodel/">Patient and Episode subrecords</a>
 - created_by, updated_by, created, updated. This gives developers easier
programatic access to high level audit trail information, without having
to navigate the <a href="https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion/blob/master/docs/api.rst">low level Django Reversion
API</a>
- which is still there for when you need more detailed audit trail
information.</p>

<h2>Select2 and List fields</h2>

<p>This release introduces
<a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select">Select2</a> to OPAL - which
provides us some nicer widgets - particularly for fields associated with
<a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/docs/guides/lookup_lists/">lookuplists</a>,
and has also enabled the development of list types as
Subrecord fields. For example this means that your travel can be to a
list of countries when you take a backpacking trip through Southeast
Asia!</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

<p>Just because this release is out, we&rsquo;re not resting on our laurels - in
fact we&rsquo;re already gearing up for the next releases. We&rsquo;re planning to
look at the information architecture of Episode detail views, including
a new Notes view that&rsquo;s currently being tested by some users of the
<a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk">elCID</a> project.</p>

<p>We also plan to refactor some of the core data models back into OPAL to provide
them there by default rather than implemented over and over again in
individual applications.</p>

<p>As ever, because OPAL is an Open Governance <a href="http://github.com/openhealthcare/opal">Open Source</a> project, you can
follow our progress over on
<a href="https://waffle.io/openhealthcare/opal-ideas">our public Waffle board</a> where we&rsquo;ll be
organising our work.</p>

          <div class="post-entry">
            <p>Just a couple of weeks ago we launched a new service at the <a href="http://www.thehtd.org/home.aspx">Hospital for Tropical Diseases</a>
in London to help the doctors and nurses who run their <a href="http://www.thehtd.org/emergencies.aspx">Emergency Walk-In Clinic</a>.
At the clinic,
travellers who have returned from the tropics and are acutely unwell turn up without requiring an appointment to get treated
by specialists in tropical diseases. The service tracks patients on their journey through the clinic, from initial triage to
following up on lab results that arrive after they&rsquo;ve left.</p>

<div class="post-thumb">
  <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/images/posts/walkin.referral.png" alt="" style="border: 2px solid black;" />
</div>


<!--//post-thumb-->


<p>We worked closely with the staff who run the clinic, making sure that we met the different needs of different types of user
- in this case admin staff, the nursing staff, doctors, as well as the service managers who wanted data on what activity was
happening. Just like we do with all of our services, we brought them into our agile development process as we iteratively
developed the service based on research and their feedback.</p>

<p>Clinical digital services too often fail to take into account the experiences of the people on the ground who have to use
them in practice. At Open Health Care we don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s acceptable for something as important as delivering health care.</p>

<p>Because of that we will continue to regularly meet with users of the service to conduct usability testing and actively seek
feedback so that we can continuously improve the service. That feedback loop needs to be a part of the ongoing operation of
digital products and services in hospitals - not just something that happens as part of an initial design phase - and we&rsquo;ve
seen before just how useful it can be as we&rsquo;ve been able to respond to changing user needs and changes to the context and
processes that surround users experiences of our services.</p>

<h2>Use data to design services.<br>It makes things better</h2>


<p>One of the key goals of the project was to allow the team at HTD to gather high quality data about the cohort of patients
that they treat. This data is hugely valuable, both academically for research purposes, and because it enables the team
to understand their workload.</p>

<p>When the tools that are used for routine day-to-day clinical care don&rsquo;t collect usable data, the cost of analysing what you&rsquo;ve
been doing become huge. With the new Walk-in service however, all of the information that the institution knows about a patient,
from demographics to observations, travel history to treatment, gets stored as high quality structured data.</p>

<p>That means that anyone can get an accurate answer to a question like &ldquo;How many patients did we see with Dengue fever in the last
year&rdquo; in seconds, rather than it taking hours or days of painstaking work reviewing case notes, or manually curating and maintaining
their own databases.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re excited about the possibilities for service redesign and research that this new capability has opened up for the team, and
we&rsquo;ve already been brainstorming ideas - so watch this space!</p>

<h2>How it all came together</h2>

<p>The service was built as a <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal-walk-in">plugin</a> for <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk">OPAL</a> -
our open source framework for building high quality digital services in a clinical setting, and is deployed as part of
<a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk">elCID - an existing service that we run for UCLH</a> to manage patients with infection.</p>

<p>We love delivering high quality digital services for doctors.
If you&rsquo;d like to explore how we might be able to help you out at your
institution, <a href="http://openhealthcare.org.uk/contact.html">get in touch</a> - we&rsquo;re always keen to meet people with interesting problems
to solve as we try and make sure that the digital services that clinical staff in the NHS use in their day jobs is as good as the
services they use in their personal lives.</p>

            <p><a href="http://ukhealthcamp.com/">UK Health Camp</a> - it&rsquo;s happening.</p>

<p>Some great things have happened to digital in the NHS over the last few years - and we&rsquo;re excited to have
played a part in it. We&rsquo;ve seen a wonderful community blossom around <a href="http://nhshackday.com/">NHS Hack Day</a>
- catalysed by their desire to make NHS IT less bad. We&rsquo;ve seen high quality, user needs focussed,
<a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare">open source</a> clinical facing <a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk/">digital services</a>
launch in an increasing number of NHS trusts. We&rsquo;ve seen open data used to
demonstrate <a href="http://www.prescribinganalytics.com/">huge potential cost savings</a> to the NHS - helping to reinforce the
commitment to transparency and openness throughout the system.</p>

<p>And those are just the pieces that we&rsquo;ve been involved with - there are so many more happening all through the NHS.</p>

<p>One of the great strengths of the NHS is its decentralization - although it&rsquo;s a public sector institution, much
decision making is devolved to a local level - which means that you see pockets of innovation springing up all around
the country as its remarkable staff strive to deliver better services to patients. The downside of decentralization is
that sometimes those innovations and best practices don&rsquo;t spread as quickly as we&rsquo;d like - which is how we end up with
variation in services.</p>

<p>We believe that local excellence is not good enough - we need scalable excellence if we&rsquo;re to deliver digital services
in health care that are fit for purpose in the twenty first century.</p>

<p>Which is why we&rsquo;ve been working with a super team of friends from across the health system to create a space to help
connect people doing great work in this space with people who understand that we need to do better, faster, wider. A
space to connect, share ideas and make things happen.</p>

<p>That space is <a href="http://ukhealthcamp.com/">UK Health Camp</a>.</p>

<p>UK Health Camp is a free unconference for everyone interested in digital, design, technology and data for health and
care. It&rsquo;s happening in London on the 28th November, and it&rsquo;s going to be the most exciting conversation around for
people who want to understand how we can deliver better services to patients by using better digital, better data and
better design.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t released tickets just yet, but we expect them to go fast when we do release them - so sign up to the mailing
list to get notified when they do become available.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p><a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Days</a> are weekend events that bring together &ldquo;geeks who love the NHS&rdquo; to have fun, build community, and work on digital projects that promote health.</p>

<p>The format is that we begin on a saturday morning with people pitching real-world problems they’ve encountered in the NHS or in health care generally. Anyone can pitch. We end on Sunday afternoon with a competition for the best solutions made over the weekend. In between people pick projects to work on, work on them, and have lunch (provided).</p>

<p>Previous NHS Hack Days have looked something like this:</p>

            <p>
                We’re a limited company based in the UK.
                We work with clients in the NHS to help build a health system fit for the
                digital age.
                We build and run digital services for clinicians who deliver direct care
                and researchers who collect data.
                We also provide digital consultancy services to institutions within the health
                sector.
