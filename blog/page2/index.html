            <p><i>This post is the prose form of a workshop we recently ran at the <a href="https://twitter.com/bisgovuk">Department for Business, Innovation and Skills</a>
about hack days.</i></p>

<p>So, you want to run a hack day?</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
A hack day is an event in which domain experts with user needs collaborate with people who have skills in delivering digital 
products and services including developers, designers, user researchers and product specialists. 
Hack days typically last between a day and a week. Some hack days are intended simply for educational or social purposes, 
although in many cases the goal is to create usable software.
</p></blockquote>


<p>Hack days are a great way to get multidisciplinary teams working together to create creative tangible solutions to real
world problems.</p>

<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>

<p>The first thing you&rsquo;ll need to figure out is <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re running a hack day.</p>

<p>There are broadly five reasons people run hack days.</p>

<ol>
<li>To build community</li>
<li>To educate people</li>
<li>To get focussed fast paced R&amp;D</li>
<li>For PR</li>
<li>er hack days are cool, what do you mean why?</li>
</ol>


<p>You should make sure you have a clear answer to <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re doing this before you start running a hack day - because this maximises the likelihood
that you and your attendees will have a great time and get lots of value from the event.</p>

<p>For instance, with <a href="http://nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a> - the events that we run around the country for &ldquo;Geeks who love the NHS&rdquo; - we have a few
reasons. We&rsquo;re aiming to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build community and friendships between members of the clinical and technology sectors</li>
<li>Show front line clinical staff just how good Digital Services can be, empowering them to demand better from their institutions when they go back to work</li>
<li>Showcase Open Source, Open Governance, and the power of collaborating in small heterogeneous teams of domain experts.</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s reasons 1, 2 and a little bit of 4.</p>

<p>You might be looking to build the cross-disciplinary skills of your teams, introducing people to Digital ways of working, thinking and approaching
problems, you might be looking to provide concrete examples of products and services aligned with your policy goals - understanding that showing is more
powerful than telling. Whatever your reason is, make sure you can explain it clearly so that you remain focussed on that throughout.</p>

<h3>What do you need to do?</h3>

<p>So, you want to run a hack day ?</p>

<p>Great!</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">lots</a> <a href="https://hackathon.guide/">of</a> <a href="http://nhshackday.com/tools/organiser-notes/">documents</a> out there that
will take you through the low level details, we&rsquo;re not going to go through those again in detail, but you basically need to put five things in a room:</p>

<ol>
<li>User needs</li>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>Power</li>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Technologists who know how to deliver Digital</li>
</ol>


<h3>Start with needs</h3>

<p>The value that comes from the event is directly related to the quality of the ideas for projects that are in the room. The <em>best</em> hack day projects
address specific real world user needs. It&rsquo;s well worth thinking about these before the event, and seeking feedback from others - particularly from
people who&rsquo;ve attended hack days before.</p>

<p>With NHS Hack Day, we encourage people to discuss their ideas on our mailing list, on Twitter, and in person
at meetups so that we can help people come with well formed ideas that inspire our attendees. For more focussed commercial hack days we work with
people to frame and present their ideas in such a way that they work well within the context of a hack day.</p>

<h3>Basic logistics</h3>

<p>Hack days have some slightly special logistical requirements of the room that you&rsquo;re going to be in. The most frequent problem is that the Wifi isn&rsquo;t
good enough. As the <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">Hack Day Manifesto</a> says:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
Don’t just trust anyone who tells you that “it’ll be fine”. People from the venue or their commercial partner will tell you all sorts of things you 
want to hear but keep in the back of your mind that they may not have any clue what they are talking about.
</p></blockquote>


<p>In addition to this, you&rsquo;ll also have lots of people wanting to plug in their laptops, so try to make sure that there is good access to power points.
Providing tea, coffee and other beverages as well as lunch and breakfast is always appreciated by attendees, as are easily accessible whiteboards,
flip charts, post-its &amp; sharpies.</p>

<h3>Making your ideas a reality</h3>

<p>At the end of your hack day, you&rsquo;ll have a wrap up session where everyone presents what they&rsquo;ve been working on. There will be lots of excitement and
energy in the room, you may even have judges and prizes! If all has gone well, several prototypes of new Digital products or services will exist that
didn&rsquo;t at the start of the day.</p>

<p>If your aim was to build community and educate people, then you should already have gone a long way to meeting your goals! Sometimes though, you will
want to find a way to take promising projects forwards and make them genuine products or services.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to do this, then it&rsquo;s worth thinking about that path before the event. This might involve providing investment or support for teams
who want to go forward with their idea, promising people time to work on their project, or giving projects marketing and promotion. The details are
often dependent on who you are, and what kinds of user needs you&rsquo;re looking to meet.</p>

<h3>Still want some more help?</h3>

          <div class="post-entry">
            <p>For the past couple of years, Open Health Care has been working in collaboration
with <a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/Pages/home.aspx">UCLH</a> and the <a href="http://www.thehtd.org/">Hospital for Tropical Diseases</a>
on <a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk/">elCID</a> (the
electronic Clinical Infection Database) - an Open Source
clinical Digital service for managing inpatients and outpatients with infections.</p>

<p>elCID solves two key clinical problems - first it provides an interface for recording day-to-day
clinical care. We&rsquo;ve developed this interface in close collaboration with clinicians with a strong focus on usability,
using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design">user centred design</a> techniques, and
frequent iterations, to make sure that we meet the real needs of our users.</p>

<p>Second, elCID captures structured data about clinical activity, and features advanced
interrogation and extract capabilities. This enables data driven feedback loops in the
design of clinical services, by enabling high quality audits to be conducted much faster
than was ever possible before.</p>

<p>Working with some of the academics who&rsquo;ve been instrumental in developing the
project, we recently published an analysis of the early findings from this process in the
<a href="http://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(15)00100-0/abstract">Journal of Infection</a>.</p>

<p>As the paper outlines:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i>
elCID brings together disparate silos of clinical data collection into a single, rapidly searchable database resource permitting unprecedented interrogation of our clinical practice. <br />
However, the benefits of the system go further, having vastly improved the quality and transparency of communication between the Division’s teams, audits of day-to-day clinical practice are now rapidly and routinely performed using high quality prospectively collected data, and research study data collection can be conducted within the main database, facilitating improved integration of the clinical and academic arms of the Division.
</p></blockquote>


<p>elCID is an Open Source, Open Governance project built on the Open Source <a href="http://opal.openhealthcare.org.uk/">OPAL</a>
framework. It is available to infection services and comes with full support and customisation from Open Health Care.
You can find out more information about the software on the <a href="http://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk/">elCID website</a>.</p>

            <p>Last weekend saw us reach a milestone as we brought
<a href="http://nhshackday.com/">NHS Hack Day back to London</a> in our tenth event in just three years!</p>

<p>NHS Hack Days are weekend events that bring together patients, healthcare and technology
professionals and other “geeks who love the NHS” under the banner of making NHS IT less bad.
It&rsquo;s always a pleasure to see so many talented people come together to share their time, skills
and experience to create something together, and this was no exception.</p>

<p>The event started with clinical staff, patients, and anyone else who felt they had a way to
make the world a little better pitching ideas that they wanted to work on. Pitches
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-needs.html">start with a User Need</a>
- for instance the surgeons who need a way to track their continuing professional development,
or the doctor who wants quick and easy offline access to formulary information. The attendees
then pick what project they want to work on, and form teams to try and build a prototype over
the weekend.</p>

<p>At the end of the weekend, we gathered together to share what we&rsquo;d learned and what we&rsquo;d built
over the weekend.</p>

<p>Some of the stand-out projects from the weekend were The Locumator - an app which helps hospital schedulers and doctors to fill vacant slots with bank staff, and Take Your Meds - a low-tech phone reminder application that sends a configurable audio message via phone call to a patient, reminding them to use the mouthwash, or take their medication.</p>

<p>This time, our cat-herder in chief was the amazing <a href="http://twitter.com/deckofpandas">@deckofpandas</a> - and we&rsquo;d like to thank her again for all of her hard work in making the event such a great
experience for everyone involved.</p>

<p>Next time looks like being Manchester in Autumn 2015 - although the venue &amp; exact date are
yet to be confirmed. We’d love it if you joined us though - so do
<a href="http://nhshackday.com/">sign up to the mailing list</a> to be kept in the loop !</p>

          <div class="post-entry">
            <p>At Open Health Care we believe in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine">Evidence Based Medicine</a>.</p>

<p>Which is why we create digital health <a href="https://github.com/openhealthcare/opal-research">services that support research</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the current infrastructure supporting evidence based medicine has some shortcomings. One of these is that
when a research paper is retracted because, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Woo-suk">the author</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct">made up the results</a>, there is little or no means
to propogate this update in the wider medical literature.</p>

<p>Supposing, as a doctor, I look to a systematic review on the management of heart attacks to inform how I treat my patient,
I sadly have no assurance that the systematic review does not rely on research papers that have been retracted. This is suboptimal.</p>

<p>Open access, post-publication peer review, and better version control would be three useful features that a modern scientific
publishing model optimized to enable good science should support.</p>

<p>In the meantime, inspired by a lunchtime conversation with our friend and director Ben Goldacre (it was all his idea),
we pondered the question:</p>

<blockquote class="custom-quote"><p><i class="fa fa-question fa-3x"></i>
What is the most cited retracted paper?
</p></blockquote>


<p>It turns out <a href="http://www.pubmed.gov">PubMed</a> already has a nice API that can return a
<a href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;retmode=json&amp;retmax=10000&amp;term=%22retracted%20publication%22">list</a>
of PubMed ids for papers that have been retracted. Next we needed a means of knowing how many times each retracted paper was cited.
There are a few ways of doing this but we went with using google scholar after Alf Eaton told us about it on
<a href="https://twitter.com/invisiblecomma/status/582904870644113408">twitter</a>. It&rsquo;s possible to search google scholar for the articles
citing a particular pubmed id, here&rsquo;s an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19336536">example</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, we used wget to download all of the google scholar search results.  This infamous
<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2897%2911096-0/abstract">paper</a> &lsquo;Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia,
non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children.&rsquo; was the winner with
2070 <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9500320">citations</a>!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the top ten:</p>

<p>You can reproduce our results or view our workings <a href="https://github.com/drcjar/retractshons">over on Github</a>.</p>

<p>There are of course many reasons other than the author making up the results for a paper to be retracted. There are also many circumstances
in which citing a retracted paper is legitimate. For a more nuanced discussion of retractions there&rsquo;s a nice <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0044118">Comprehensive Survey of
Retracted Articles from the Scholarly Literature</a> in PLOS and the
excellent <a href="http://retractionwatch.com/">Retraction Watch</a> covers the details of individual retractions as they happen.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was fun to examine retractions. We&rsquo;d love to explore this further so if we can be of service to you do get in touch.</p>

<p>Perhaps a project for <a href="http://www.nhshackday.com">NHS Hack Day</a>?</p>

            <p>
                We’re a limited company based in the UK.
                We work with clients in the NHS to help build a health system fit for the
                digital age.
                We build and run digital services for clinicians who deliver direct care
                and researchers who collect data.
                We also provide digital consultancy services to institutions within the health
                sector.
